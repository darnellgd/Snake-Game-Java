## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

`src` contains main game file "SnakeGame.java". Run to play game

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
